## Example

#### Checking DevSecops compliance for a specific application

```
./veracode-cli -user '<API_KEY>' -pass '<API_SECRET>' -command 'compliancecheck' -appname '<Application Profile Name>' -buildname <build name>
```

If the application is not compliant

```
2020/02/03 07:12:23 ComplianceCheck
2020/02/03 07:12:23 Finding App ID
2020/02/03 07:12:26 App ID:  ****
2020/02/03 07:12:26 Requesting build info
2020/02/03 07:12:27 The build status is [Results Ready]
2020/02/03 07:12:27 Requesting full report
2020/02/03 07:12:28 [Result] { High & V.High: 0 , Medium: 37 }
2020/02/03 07:12:28 [Error] your application is not compliant!
```

#### Checking Application status.

2020/02/03 06:33:01 Finding App ID
2020/02/03 06:33:04 App ID:  ***
2020/02/03 06:33:04 Requesting build info
2020/02/03 06:33:05 The build status is [Incomplete]
2020/02/03 06:33:05 Deleting last build
2020/02/03 06:33:06 [Success] The scan was stuck and successfully deleted.
```

$ go get github.com/mitchellh/gox
$ gox --output veracode-cli_{{.OS}}_{{.Arch}}
```
